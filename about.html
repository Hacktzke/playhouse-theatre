          The Playhouse Theatre, located in Auckland city of New Zealand, dates
          back to 1923 when it was originally used as an old-time music-hall. At
          its height, the theatre was a glorious building reflecting the décor
          of the inter-war period. Gradually the theatre fell into disrepair in
          the 1950&#39;s as a result of other forms of entertainment being
          readily available and finally closed its doors in 1957. The building
          was acquired in 2008 by a trust set up to restore the grand old
          building to its former glory. After much hard work and financial
          input, The Playhouse Theatre was re-opened in 2012 resplendent in its
          original condition, a working museum.

            The Playhouse Theatre Museum explores different aspects of
            theatrical history through paintings, photographs, costumes, and
            memorabilia collected over 100 years. But it is not the exhibition
            of history, but the experience of the Theatre itself that sets the
            place apart from other museums, according to museum director George
            Tongariro. While the official theatre was The Royal Theatre, The
            Court Theatre was equivalent to what would today be the King&#39;s
            private television lounge and when you step in here, you sense the
            history everywhere. Indeed, with the original interior still intact,
            visitors may sit down in one of the plush velvet chairs, surrounded
            by the royal boxes and intricately decorated ceilings, letting
            themselves be transported right back to the 20th century.
